"""Persisted record of the most recent news-signals sweep (WP-42/WP-43).

The news sweep (``src.signals.news.run_news_signals``) runs unattended on a
schedule with no one watching its logs. WP-43's "Last sweep" surface in the
Tips inbox needs somewhere to read that state back from without parsing log
files, so the sweep also writes one small summary record here after every
run - same store-class-over-the-shared-kv-table shape as
``PublicVisibilityStore``/``DomainOverridesStore`` (see ``src/storage/db.py``
for the kv table itself).

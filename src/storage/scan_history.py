"""Persisted scan run history (WP-5) - the ``scans`` table.

Every scan that actually runs through ``ScanManager._run_scan`` (dry runs and
the agent's ``--discover`` workflow never reach it - see scan_manager.py) gets
one row: written at start (``status="running"``) and updated in place at
completion, failure, or cancellation. This is the source of truth for "what
did a scan cost last time" - the cost-projection feature (WP-7) blends these
actuals with the static ``estimate_cost()`` formula once a scope has enough
completed runs to trust the average.

``channels`` is stored as a JSON array (text) since SQLite has no native
array type; ``list()`` deserializes it back for callers.

``record_domains``/``measured_rates`` (WP-23/WP-25) work off a second table,
``scan_domains`` - one row per domain per scan, holding the funnel counts
``ScanManager`` tracks in memory during a run. ``measured_rates`` feeds back
into ``ScanManager.estimate_cost()`` once there is enough completed-scan
history to calibrate against, in place of its static assumptions.

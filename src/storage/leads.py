"""Lead queue: candidate policy pointers awaiting a chase.

News signals and community submissions produce leads, not policies.
A lead holds a URL and enough context to decide whether to "chase" it
(run the full analysis pipeline against it) or dismiss it. This keeps
expensive model spend human-gated and capped.

Persistence is SQLite-backed (see ``src/storage/db.py``); this module
keeps the same public interface the JSON-file version had.

"""Shared non-admin review-status clamping for public read endpoints (WP-3
"public review visibility"). Used by GET /api/policies, GET
/api/policies/search, GET /api/coverage, and GET /api/coverage/children.

Rejected policies are never returned, counted, or shaded for a non-admin
caller, regardless of any parameter. The coarse ``?review=`` query param
(``reviewed`` | ``all``) plus the admin's posture setting decide the rest;
admins are exempt entirely — unclamped, exactly as before this feature.

"""World-map coverage — read-only aggregate of where PolicyPulse has looked.

``GET /api/coverage`` answers "which countries have tracked sources or found
policies, and what sits above the country level" in one shot, so the map can
color countries before anyone types a word. Nothing is precomputed or stored:
every count is derived at request time from the canonical jurisdiction
registry (``src/core/jurisdictions.py``) applied to the existing policy data
and domain configs. Adding a source or finding a policy changes the response
with no schema change and no backfill.

Attribution rules (uniform for policies and sources):
- ``resolve_text`` / registry slug -> a ``Jurisdiction``.
- ``country_of`` rolls ``country``/``us_state``/``subnational`` up to a
  country, keyed by ``iso_numeric`` (the world-atlas join key).
- Jurisdictions with no map shape become ``supranational`` (off-map) entries
  keyed by slug: ``supranational``/``group`` kinds (the EU, a future ``global``
  IGO bucket) AND countries the registry carries without an ``iso_numeric``
  (e.g. Kosovo). "EU" is never hardcoded — whatever the registry returns is
  handled, and null-iso countries never land in ``countries`` under a None key.
- Source counts attribute a domain to a country once per country, however many
  of its ``region`` tags roll up there. Off-map entries carry a ``sources``
  count too, but only for null-iso countries; supranational/group entries stay
  policy-driven (a broad ``region`` tag like ``nordic`` is not a chip).
- Each country entry also carries ``children_with_data``: the count of its
  ``us_state``/``subnational`` children (per the registry) with >=1 policy or
  source resolved *directly* to them (no roll-up). 0 means not drillable.

``GET /api/coverage/children?parent=<country-slug>`` answers "what does this
one country look like broken out by state/province" — the drill-down behind
``children_with_data``. Unlike the world view, nothing is rolled up: a policy
or source lands under ``national`` only if it resolves to the country
jurisdiction itself, under a child only if it resolves to that exact child,
and nowhere in this response if it resolves elsewhere. ``national`` and each
child are kept visually distinct so a federal/nationwide policy is never
mistaken for a single-state one.

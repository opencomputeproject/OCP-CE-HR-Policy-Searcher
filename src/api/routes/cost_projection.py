"""GET /api/cost-projection (WP-7) — a funding-conversation number.

Blends the static per-scan ``ScanManager.estimate_cost()`` formula with real
outcomes recorded by ``ScanHistoryStore`` (WP-5) into a monthly/weekly/
quarterly budget figure per scope group.

Blend rule
----------
Once a domain_group has at least **2** completed scan-history runs, its mean
actual cost (``ScanHistoryStore.stats()['mean_cost_usd']``) is a better
predictor of what the next run will cost than the static formula, so
``per_month_usd`` is computed from the mean. Below that threshold (0 or 1
completed runs) there isn't enough signal to trust an average over a single
data point, so the static per-scan estimate is used instead. ``history`` in
the response is still populated whenever there is at least one completed
run — even when the blend itself falls back to the estimate — so a caller
can see "this ran once, here's what it actually cost" rather than nothing.

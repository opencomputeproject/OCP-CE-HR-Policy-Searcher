"""A fingerprint of everything that decides whether a page is relevant.

The URL cache remembers a verdict against a URL, a content hash and an
expiry. It does not remember which rules produced the verdict, so a page
judged irrelevant under one keyword file stays judged irrelevant after that
file changes. Tuning work then measures a mixture of old and new rules and
the result reads as noise.

This module produces a short hash over the inputs that can change a
verdict: the keyword configuration, the analysis settings (thresholds and
the data-centre scope rule), and the two prompts. The cache stores it
alongside each entry and treats a mismatch as a miss.

Two things are deliberately excluded. Comments and blank lines in the
keyword file are stripped before hashing, so documenting a keyword does not
throw away a month of cached analysis. And only the analysis section of the
settings file is read: crawl delays, output destinations and logging cannot
change what a page is, and including them would expire the cache for
edits that decide nothing.

Note the existing seven-day expiry on negative verdicts, which already
limited how long a wrong rejection could persist. This closes the same hole
for the thirty-day positive entries and makes the effect immediate rather
than eventual.

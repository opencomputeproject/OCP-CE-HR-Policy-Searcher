"""The labelled set the pipeline is measured against, and what must survive.

Nothing in this system measured whether a change helped. The 21 per cent
precision figure came from a person counting by hand, and there was nowhere
to put the answer back, so every subsequent tuning argument would have been
opinion against opinion.

Two pieces live here. The golden set is versioned labels, one row per
document, keep or reject with the reason category. Protected recall is the
much smaller list of documents that any change must still retrieve, no
matter what it does to precision.

**Where the protected list comes from matters.** These are not documents
chosen because they are convenient to retrieve. Most of the original
thirteen were the curated master tab of the Heat Reuse Policies Database,
which is what a human reviewer decided to keep, seven of them entered by
hand. One, Virginia HB 323, is the first state law on data centre heat
reuse, absent from the production database on 2026-08-28 and the reason any
of this work happened.

Measured on 2026-08-28, applying the required scope rule to the name and
description held in the sheet, three of the original thirteen looked likely
to be dropped: the NYSERDA Heat Recovery Program, the EMB3RS heat and cold
matching platform, and the New York Utility Thermal Energy Network and Jobs
Act. That was an upper bound rather than a prediction, because the live
gate reads the full source document and those three might still name a
data centre somewhere in it.

The reviewer's own column, read 2026-09-02 (WP-1), settled one of those
three: she marked the New York Utility Thermal Energy Network and Jobs Act
Remove ("no reference to data centers"), so it comes off the list below
rather than staying as a floor the tool is asked to keep meeting forever.
NYSERDA and EMB3RS remain, still at risk from the scope rule and still
listed so the test says the day it costs one, instead of it happening
quietly. Separately, she also marked the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact
Remove ("private sector initiative") - unrelated to the scope-rule risk
above, but the same column, the same read, and the same reason to drop it
from the floor. Her 32 keeps join the list too (deduplicated against the
entries already here), each carrying her own reason so a failure names what
she said rather than only that something was lost.

"""In-app scheduled scans (WP-11) - an asyncio background task, not APScheduler.

Runs as an ``asyncio.create_task`` started at FastAPI startup and cancelled
at shutdown (see ``ScheduleRunner`` below, wired in ``src/api/app.py``'s
lifespan). Every ``TICK_SECONDS`` it walks every enabled schedule whose
``next_run_at`` has passed and, for each one:

1. Skips it (logging ``schedule_skipped_busy``) if ``ScanManager`` already
   has a pending/running scan for the exact same scope - two overlapping
   runs of the same domains would just race each other and double-spend.
2. Pauses it (logging ``schedule_skipped_ceiling``, setting
   ``paused_reason``) if a ``monthly_ceiling_usd`` is configured and this
   month's completed-scan spend for that scope has already reached it.
   This never disables the schedule - ``month_spend()`` resets at the next
   UTC calendar month, so a paused schedule resumes on its own the first
   time it comes due after the ceiling clears, no admin action needed.
3. Otherwise clears any stale ``paused_reason``, optionally runs the review
   import (below), and fires the scan through ``ScanManager.start_scan`` -
   the exact same path a manual scan takes - then records the new scan_id
   and the newly computed ``next_run_at``.

Every decision above writes a ``log_audit_event`` (``schedule_fired`` /
``schedule_skipped_busy`` / ``schedule_skipped_ceiling``) alongside the
scan's own ``scan_started`` audit event.

**Review import gate** (WP-2, ADR-0005 proposed - off by default). When
``manager.config.settings.output.import_reviews_before_scan`` is true,
``fire_schedule`` runs ``src.output.import_reviews.import_reviews`` (not a
dry run) immediately before ``start_scan``, so the store's review status
reflects her column before this scan's own dedup/same-instrument checks run
against it, and logs the summary. A review import must never block the
monthly scan: a failure to reach or read the sheet (a gspread API error,
a missing review header, bad credentials, a filesystem error) is caught
and logged as a warning, and the scan fires anyway. A programming error
in the importer is not caught: it should fail loudly, not silently skip. A
``manager`` with no ``config`` attribute (any test double that does not set
one) simply skips this step, matching today's behavior.

Resilience: one schedule's ``start_scan`` raising, or the store's
``list()``/``month_spend()`` blowing up, must never take the other
schedules - or the next tick - down with it. Every layer that can fail is
wrapped and logged rather than left to propagate. ``run_due_schedules`` is
one tick, factored out as a standalone coroutine precisely so it can be
unit-tested without the real 60-second loop (see tests/unit/test_schedule_runner.py).
